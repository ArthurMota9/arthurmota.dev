During my time at [Aurum Software](https://www.aurum.com.br/), I gained valuable experience working for a company that's at the forefront of **SaaS development for lawyers and law firms**. I spent almost four years with the company, and they are committed to providing innovative solutions to their clients.

**Astrea Viewer** is an internal application used by sales and customer service teams to access customer information and perform account-related actions.

I received the challenge from our Tech Lead to **re-design this application**. The project delivery time was two weeks, and the front end wa was two weeks, and the front end was composed of the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) library and [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/). In a talk with a front-end developer on our team, I decided to migrate from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/), a *lib* based on Material Design.

I was able **to complete the project** (fully responsive) on time.

**Technologies:** AngularJS, HTML + CSS, Gulp, Sass, Materialize.
