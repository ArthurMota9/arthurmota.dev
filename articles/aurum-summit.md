![Aurum Summit PWA.](/static/img/posts/aurum-summit-pwa.png)

I always think about **adding something valuable** to the company that I'm working for. With my Tech Lead's help, **we created an app** for the event organized by [Aurum](https://www.aurum.com.br/), Aurum Summit.

### The problem

Have you ever attended an **event or a Meetup** and felt lost because you needed to know the order of the lectures or the schedule? We had the same thought and decided to **develop an app** that would provide all the necessary information, such as the **event schedule, details of the speakers and the lectures**, information about the sponsors, and a section for the participants to **give feedback on the speakers**, subjects addressed, and more.

We faced a problem as the event date was quickly approaching, and I still needed time to **research and study mobile development**, develop and submit the product to the app stores (Google Play and Apple Store), and so on. **Due to the limited time**, every hour of work was crucial, and we couldn't afford to waste it. As many people know, waiting for the app stores to review the app was not ideal, as it was a luxury we couldn't afford.

### Solution

After raising all these points with the help of a frontend developer, we decided to create a [PWA Progressive Web App](https://web.dev/explore/progressive-web-apps?hl=es-419), a development methodology resulting from combining **the best user experiences in applications and the web**. I developed using **Vue.js** because I already had some experience with Hydra.

**Technologies:** Vue.js, HTML + CSS, Webpack, Heroku, Firebase.
